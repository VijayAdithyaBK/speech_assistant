Python Speech Assistant
The Speech Assistant is a Python script that allows users to interact with a voice-controlled assistant. It uses speech recognition to capture voice input and performs various actions based on user commands. The assistant can provide information such as its name, current time, perform web searches, find locations on Google Maps, and more. It converts text to speech using Google Text-to-Speech and plays the audio response. Users can have a conversation with the assistant by speaking commands and receiving spoken responses. The script provides a basic framework that can be customized and extended to add additional functionality.
